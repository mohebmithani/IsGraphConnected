# IsGraphConnected
“Is Graph Connected?” is one of my academic projects for the implementation of theory of computation. It is a GUI project which takes an undirected graph of maximum 5 nodes from the user and tells whether the graph is connected or not. The GUI part is done with **JavaFX Material Design** and the calculation/processing is done with the help of **Turing Machine**.
